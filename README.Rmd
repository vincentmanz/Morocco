## Abstract

Differences in knowledge about plants across genders are contingent to specific cultural domains, yet the boundaries between food and medicine are blurred and it is unclear if and how gender plays a role in creating such continuum. Here, we present an in-depth evaluation of the links between gender, medicinal plant knowledge, and culinary culture in Marrakech, Morocco. We interviewed 30 women and 27 men with different socio-demographic characteristics and evaluated how gender and cooking frequency shape their food and medicinal plant knowledge. We documented 171 ethno-taxa used in Marrakshi households as food, medicine or both, corresponding to 148 botanical taxa and three mixtures. While no clear differences appear in food plant knowledge by gender, women have a three-fold greater knowledge of medicinal plants, as well as plants with both ambivalent uses. Women’s medicinal and food plant knowledge increases with their reported frequency of cooking, whereas the opposite trend is observed among men. The profound relations between the culinary and health domains are mediated through gender. 

**KEYWORDS:** Food-medicine continuum; functional foods; gastronomy; Marrakech; Morocco; pharmacopeia; spices; women’s knowledge.
